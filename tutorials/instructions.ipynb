    "The `ClusterConformations()` class can be used to handle the following tasks for clustering protein chains:\n",
    " - Creating pairwise CA distance matrices\n",
    " - Generate CA distance difference matrices between all chains\n",
    " - Scores global conformational changes based on these matrices\n",
    " - Cluster chains, via UPGMA clustering\n",

    "\n",
    "To begin clustering, identify all chains which overlap the same stretch of a given UniProt sequence. Functionally, there is no limit to the amount of sequence overlap (higher is preferred) because the score function will handle this via its prefactor. However, structures with extremely little sequence overlap will return small scores, potentially getting clustered along with chains that truly share structural similarity. Gaps in the sequence are ignored when calculating chain-chain distance difference matrices but are accounted for in the score's pre-factor. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once all desired chains have been identified, you can quickly download them using the `fetch_updated_mmcif()` function. In the case of P46060, the code block below downloads all structures pertaining to the protein's C-terminal domain. The `fetch_updated_mmCIF()` function saves the structure files to your parsed directory, in the updated mmCIF file format. This format is especially important for clustering as it contains UniProt residue numbering from SIFTS, an essential index for matching residues between structures without performing an expensive sequence alignment.

Q-score is ordinarily used for scoring the superposition of parsed peptide chains, which are fragmented to obtain good alignment around structurally conserved regions. \n",
